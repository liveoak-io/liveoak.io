== Windows

Go to link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[]

Select `JDK Downloads`. You get redirected to another page.

Accept the License Agreement, then choose `windows-x64` download.

When download completes run the installer and follow the steps.


== Linux

Fedora comes with `OpenJDK` package as part of the repository. To install type:

`su -c "yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel"`

Then, itâ€™s best to make this version of Java the default version used by all applications via alternatives:

`su -c "alternatives --config java"`

Another way to use the correct version of Java is to put it on the `PATH` e.g.:

`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.5`

`export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH`



== Mac OS X

Go to link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[]

Select `JDK Downloads`. You get redirected to another page.

Accept the License Agreement, then choose `macosx-x64` download.

When download completes run the installer and follow the instructions.

To use the correct Java version from Terminal set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

`export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home`
